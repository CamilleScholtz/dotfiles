scripts
=======

Various scripts I made, README.md is WIP.

arya
----
Emerge wrapper for Gentoo. Just a very simple bash script but it does the job. I wanted to copy the simple syntax of Arch's Pacman & Aura.

bashmission
-----------
Super WIP (aka not working) transmission "front-end" written in bash, yup.

clock
-----
Just a simple dzen2 clock, I position the clock with FVWM.

misc
----
Misc scripts, most of these are NOT my own work and are just completly copypasted with some slight changes.

music
-----
Music button, on hover a popup appears with info about the song, artist & album, also shows album art with feh. Again these windows are placed with FVWM.

notify
------
My very own "notification system" using URxvt, currently displays MPD and rtorrent notifications. It's very easy to make support for other programs if you can get the info from the program (I get the MPD info from mpc and ncmpcpp, the rtorrent info from rtorrent, etc.).

pager
-----
This is not actually a pager, but just a button with an icon next to fvwmpager, pure eye-candy.

todo
----
A window that show number of lines in your todo text file.
